# VCV Services

*VCV BACKGROUND*: As a VCV Rack user and developer for over three years, I believe I developed the knowledge to help others.  I have developed JW-Modules and have created hundreds of advanced VCV Rack patches.  I have also developed thousands of followers on social media for my work on VCV Rack.  People constantly ask me for personal help and I thought I would try it out. I have done this twice with two great people who I can give as references.  

*FEE*: 1-on-1 zoom session for $25.  Message me if there is an issue with price.

*NOTE*: I will also do *very* basic module development lessons during a session instead of vcv rack tutorials.
